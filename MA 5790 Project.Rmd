# Data Description 
For this project, we are using the dataset 'Predicting Divorce' (https://www.kaggle.com/csafrit2/predicting-divorce). The goal of using this dataset, is to predict if a couple is likely to get divorced in the future. All 54 of the predictor variables are categorical and are ranked on a scale from 0-4, with 0 being the lowest and 4 being the highest. The variable that is the outcome, is Divorce (Y/N), coded in binary. The predictor variables as described on Kaggle are as follows: 

1.	If one of us apologizes when our discussion deteriorates, the discussion ends.
2.	I know we can ignore our differences, even if things get hard sometimes.
3.	When we need it, we can take our discussions with my spouse from the beginning and correct it.
4.	When I discuss with my spouse, to contact him will eventually work.
5.	The time I spent with my wife is special for us.
6.	We don't have time at home as partners.
7.	We are like two strangers who share the same environment at home rather than family.
8.	I enjoy our holidays with my wife.
9.	I enjoy traveling with my wife.

14.	Most of our goals for people (children, friends, etc.) are the same.

#Adding Predictors
Since all of our predictors are categorical, we do not need to add any predictors. 

#Deleting Predictors
```{r deleting predictors}

#Imputation
Since we do not have any missing values, we have no need to imputate any variables. 

#Center and Scale
No need to center and scale since all variables are on the same categorical scale of 0-4. 

#Spatial Sign
No need for spatial sign
